Search is an augmented reality scavenger hunt game.

A creator walks around, see an area where they want to leave a digital object.
They take a photo of that place, leave an object, hinting at where this object is located.  Once a searcher enters the area, they can see challenges in that area and take out their phone to try and catch a photo of that object.

Process of review! Players are encouraged to accept or decline a submitted challenge they've created and that other players have participated in. You can swipe left (decline) or right (accept) to a submission that someone has made on your challenge. We put the players in charge of this system to facilitate a more community stimulated game.

History
-------
Search wasn't initially an augmented reality scavenger hunt game. It has gone through several iterations. It started as simply a photo hunt game where users can take a picture of an object or a picture at a particular angle for other nearby users to find and try to emulate.

How was AR implemented?
-----------------------
We looked into Vuforia, Layar, Wikitude, and other incredibly ready-made AR libraries. Given our budget (we really didn't have one), we went with using Unity, a game development platform that was free to use. 

Challenges that went with using Unity:
1. Learning a new language and developing on a new environment
2. Importing Unity in to Android Studio
3. Finding up to date resources online in relation to Android + Unity
4. ...

Final Notes
-----------
This was a month long project presented at Google on Coalition for Queens Android 3.3 Demo Day. We wanted to demonstrate a project that was technically challenging and fun to tackle within the time span.

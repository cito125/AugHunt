Search is an augmented reality scavenger hunt game.

A creator walks around, see an area where they want to leave a digital object.
They take a photo of that place, leave an object, hinting at where this object is located.  Once a searcher enters the area, they can see challenges in that area and take out their phone to try and catch a photo of that object.

Process of review! Players are encouraged to accept or decline a submitted challenge they've created and that other players have participated in. You can swipe left (decline) or right (accept) to a submission that someone has made on your challenge. We put the players in charge of this system to facilitate a more community stimulated game.

History
-------
Search wasn't initially an augmented reality scavenger hunt game. It has gone through several iterations. It started as simply a photo hunt game where users can take a picture of an object or a picture at a particular angle for other nearby users to find and try to emulate.

How was AR implemented?
-----------------------
We looked into Vuforia, Layar, Wikitude, and other incredibly ready-made AR libraries. Given our budget (we really didn't have one), we went with using Unity, a game development platform that was free to use. 

Challenges that went with using Unity:
1. Learning a new language and developing on a new environment
2. Importing Unity in to Android Studio (We didn't believe was possible given that they're two different environments)
3. Finding up to date resources online in relation to Android + Unity
4. ...

Final Notes
-----------
This was a month long project presented at Google on Coalition for Queens Android 3.3 Demo Day. We wanted to demonstrate a project that was technically challenging and fun to tackle within the time span.
